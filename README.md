# YOLO-image-classification
This project focuses on classifying skin diseases using YOLOv8, a state-of-the-art deep learning model. The model is trained on a dataset of skin disease images categorized into four classes: Melanoma, Psoriasis, Acne, and Actinic Keratosis (AK). The goal is to develop a highly accurate image classification model that can assist in early detection and diagnosis.
To enhance model interpretability, Eigen-CAM is used to generate heatmaps that highlight important regions in the image contributing to the classification decision.
Why Eigen-CAM? Eigen-CAM provides more focused visual explanations compared to traditional Grad-CAM.
